which introduces us to the critical state theory to characterize a specific soil. First, conceptual development of the subject is carried out to later consider it to a application case and understand the behavior of this model.""")
st.markdown("#### 1. Introduction")
st.write("""The study of constitutive models has had a great evolution in academic sphere, but its application practice in design has been limited, 
mainly due to its low diffusion and the need to use a greater number of parameters than those required in traditional methodologies. On the other hand, 
the use of computer applications specialized in geotechnics become popular, which include within their options, the use of models based on the critical state theory. 
One of these models is called Modified Cam-Clay (MCC). The MCC model (Roscoe and Burland, 1968), is relatively easy to use and its Parameters can be found by conventional laboratory tests. However, it is not always adjusted to the real behavior of the materials.""")
